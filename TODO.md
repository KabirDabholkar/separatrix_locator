## Project TODOs

- [ ] Resolve gradient descent on KEF torch device bug.
- [ ] Clarify README quick-start to cover the full workflow (train, prepare, find separatrix, interpret outputs).
- [ ] Update notebook tutorials to assume the package is installed, explain key hyperparameters, and include separatrix/validation steps.
- [ ] Document expected shapes and requirements for user-provided dynamics and distributions.
- [ ] Explain or expose configuration for the gradient-descent function composition pipeline.
- [ ] Fix or remove stale CLI entry points so they match the current API.
- [ ] Audit references to `init_models` or other legacy hooks and clean up fallback paths.
- [ ] Update docs/usages after the RHS function callable refactor.
- [ ] Run tests or sanity checks after refactors if available.
